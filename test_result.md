# Test Results Log

Date: 2025-07-15

Summary:
- Initial repository did not match platformâ€™s expected structure (no /backend, /frontend). App was a Vite React + Flask stack under /app.
- Implemented quick fixes (Option 1) to make app functional without major refactor:
  - Added a FastAPI gateway at /app/backend/server.py that mounts the existing Flask app via WSGI, exposing all routes under /api on 0.0.0.0:8001 (as required by ingress/supervisor).
  - Created /app/backend/requirements.txt and installed dependencies.
  - Fixed API contract mismatch: frontend expected GET /api/mastery/get-subjects returning {status, subjects}. Added this endpoint to Flask blueprint with enriched schema matching MasteryDashboard.
  - Ensured SQLite database directory is created before SQLAlchemy init.
- Frontend not restarted by supervisor since repo has no /frontend dir. For now, focus on backend correctness and API health.

Planned Backend Tests:
- GET /api/health should return {status:"healthy"}
- GET /api/mastery/get-subjects should return {status:"success", subjects:[...]}
- GET /api/learning/progress should return progress JSON
- GET /api/spaced-repetition/get-schedule?days_ahead=3 should return schedule
- POST /api/spaced-repetition/create-card with JSON body should return card
- POST /api/spaced-repetition/review-card with JSON body should return updated_card
- POST /api/user/register + POST /api/user/login flows
- POST /api/analysis/generate-plan with JSON body should return plan

Notes:
- Frontend fetch calls use "/api/..." paths, which align with ingress rules.
- If frontend serving is needed, we can build Vite and place dist into /app/static for Flask to serve index.html. Not done yet (awaiting instruction).
